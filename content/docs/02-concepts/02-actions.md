## Actions

Actions are instructions available in the [`Preset` singleton](/docs/concepts/configuration/#singleton). They are a layer of abstraction for diverse kind of manipulations, such as copies, editions, deletions, installations, and more.

They are the key concept of Preset. They are easy to use and powerful enough to make almost any kind of preset.

## Available actions

The following actions are implemented. Note that each of them implement [`Action`](/docs/api/action), which has a few useful methods.
